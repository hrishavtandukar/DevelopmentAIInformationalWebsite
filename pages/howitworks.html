				<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is basically a digital simulation of the processes performed by an intelligent being. The term, AI is generally used to describe a simulated digital human intelligence that can learn anduse reason like we do. Since its inception, computers have proven to be extremely efficient at carrying outcomplex tasks . Still, despite the technological boom we are experiencing today, computers are nowhere near to simulating human intelligence. There are signs of progress, however small the progress may be. We can find computers in hospitals giving out diagnosis. Computers can now recognize handwriting.<br> Wondering how they might work is only natural. They are very similar to the usual computer programs but they are programmed to learn and to adapt rather than to do certain things. Complex algorithms gives them several abilities such as Learning, Reasoning, Problem Solving, Perception and Language. In simple terms, they are programmed with algorithms that give them the ability to adapt according to the requirements and learn new things without having programmers to program them to do so.</p>

			<p>AI can learn in various ways. The trial and error method is the simplest. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encounters the same position, it can recall the solution. This type of learning is relatively easier than learning through a process called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by memorisation will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.</p>

			<div>
				<p>Problem solving, particularly inartificial intelligence, can be defined as asystematic search through a range ofpossible actions in order to reach somepredefined goal or solution. There are twotypes of problem-solving methods; specialpurpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means end analysis a step-by-step, reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of meansin the case of a simple robot this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT until the goal is reached. Many diverse problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating "virtual objects" in a computer-generated world.

			<h2><center>Reasoning</center></h2>

				<p>To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either deductive orinductive. An example of the former is, "Fred must be in either the museum or the cafe. He is not in the cafe;therefore he is in the museum," and of the latter, "Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure;therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure." The most significant difference between these forms ofreasoning is that in the deductive case the facts are gathered to produce a solution, whereas in the inductive casethe solution is projected into facts without giving absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science,where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules.</p>
				<p>There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences relevant to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.</p>

				<p>When an AI perceives its surrounding, it deconstructs the many different components and forms a spatialrelationship between the components. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear differentdepending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and howmuch the object contrasts with the surrounding field.
				<br>
			
				At present, artificial perception is sufficiently well advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals,autonomous vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road, and robots to roam through buildingscollecting empty soda cans. One of the earliest systems to integrate perception and action was FREDDY, a stationary robot with a moving television eye and a pincer hand, constructed at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1966-73 under the direction of Donald Michie. FREDDY was able to recognize a variety of objects and could be instructed to assemble simple artifacts, such as a toy car, from a random heap of components.

					A language is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to thespoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini language, it being a matter of convention. For example anexclamation mark is a the universal symbol of danger. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaningby convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called natural meaning, exemplified in statementssuch as "Those clouds mean rain" and "The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning."
					An importantcharacteristic of full-fledged human languages-in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs-is their productivity. A productivelanguage can formulate an unlimited variety of sentences.
					<br>
				
					It is relatively easy to write computer programs that seem able, in severely restricted contexts, to respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements. (For examples see BTW: Dialogue with Parry and BTW: Dialogue with SHRDLU). Although none of these programs actually understands language, they may, in principle, reach the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human. What, then, is involved in genuine understanding, if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand? There is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question. According to one theory, whether or not one understands depends not only on one's behaviour but also on one's history: in order to be said to understand, one must have learned the language and have been trained to take one's place in the linguistic community by means of interaction with other language users.

			<p>In the picture, every frame of the robot's 5 senses are stored in memory. These pathways store the linear data that the robot goes through to do a certain task. There are certain goals and rules that are automatically done by the robot without given the instructions. For example, the robot knows it has to stay a certain distance from the stove or the current task is to cook spagetti. These tasks are implied in the pathways and doesn't require the robot's conscious to remind the robot all the different rules and goals it needs to do. Only the most important facts/rules are activated by the conscious. The human brain is very primitive and it can only focus on several things at any given moment in time. The pathways guide the robot to do things automatically, while the robot's conscious gives the most important facts/rules during specific times.</p>
