		<div id="intro">
			<p>The idea of Artificial Intelligence has been around for centuries. If we look back in time, there are reports of the term 'clever machines' being used even in Greek Mythologies. There has been many studies, research and discoveries since then which has formed a base for the AI that we know today. Different people contributed in their own way in the course of history for the field of AI. Today we have AI integrated devices in our hands and our homes because of the events which are now history. Some major events in the history of AI have been included below.</p>

				<p>The actual history of Artificial Intelligence starts when Alan Turing, an english mathematician pioneered the concept of AI in the 1950s. He tended to the issue of manmade brainpower in his 1950 paper "Processing apparatus and knowledge" and proposed a trial known as the Turing Test which is a test to determine whether or not a computer is able to think like a human. The test has proven itself over conterfeit consciousness several times. </p>
				<p style="padding-top:10px;">However, 'Artificial Intelligence' had not been termed until 1956. Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy coined the term 'Artificial Intelligence' in 1956. They helped to lay the foundations of the field of Artificial Intelligence. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as humans. He wrote a book called 'Perceptrons' describing 'Artificial Neural Network' which is now knows as Deep Learning.</p>

				<p>John McCarthy was an American PC researcher. He and Minsky were known as the father of Artificial Intelligence. The goal of his research was to investigate approaches to make a machine that could reason like a human, equipped for unique thought, critical thinking and self-change. He trusted that "each part of learning or whatever other component of insight can on a basic level be so absolutely portrayed that a machine can be made to mimic it." McCarthy had recieved the Turing Award for his contributions in the field of AI.</p>
				<p> Since then, many developments have been made. The time period between 1956-1974 was considered as the golden age of Artificial Intelligence. Many important developments were made during this time such as Communication in Natural Language by AI and Reasoning as search which basically means the search algorithms used by AI were improved drastically. All of the developments of the golden age of AI are still used in the modern day devices and technologies.</p>

				<p> The late 70s (1974-1980) was considered as  AI winter. Several problems arised in the field of AI. Problems such as lack of funds and heave critisizms led to the downfall of AI. The research and development works required huge amount of funds and the lack of funds led to very less development in the field. Moreover, AI was heavily critisized. They were in such a great rate that people were discouraged and people stopped believing in the miracles that AI could supposedly perform.</p>
				<p>With the rise of expert systems in the 80s, AI rised once again. A program that answers questions or solves problems about specific topic, using logic is known as an expert system. It developed in 1980. An expert system called XCON was a great success. Along with that the fifth generation computer (A computer that could interpret pictures, translate languages, have a conversation and reason like a human) grabbed the attention of many which was a great development in the field of AI. These developments led to huge fundings giving rise to AI once again and people started believing in AI once again.</p>
				<p>There were not many achievements after that until 1989. On 1989, IBM developed a chess-playing computer, Deep Blue. There were chess-playing computers before but this one special because on 1997 it defeated world chess champion. Along with that, an intelligent agent was developed in the late 80s. An Intelligent Agent is a system that percieves its environment and takes action which maximizes chances of success.</p>

				<p>There has been many achievements in the field of AI. Most of the devices and the technolgies that we use today are based on AI. This is how the common technologies that use AI, such as Siri, Chess AI, Smart Home Appliances were originated. All of them are based on the years of research and development in the field of AI. The field of AI has been growing rapidly and the developments till date are still just a glimpse of what is yet to come. </p>
