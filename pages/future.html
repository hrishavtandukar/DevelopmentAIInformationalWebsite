		<div id="intro_para">
			<p>Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since it was first innovated. Numerous developments have been made and what started as a simple idea has been brought to life. It sure has helped us alot in our daily lives and is making our lives much easier but the full potential of Artificial Intelligence has not been reached yet. The AI that we know today is still not the final form. AI will continue to evolve.</p>
			<p>John McCarthy stated that AI which could think like a human(human level AI) will appear by 2029 using Moore's law. THe possibilities with the human level AI are countless and if that does not surprise you than there is Artificial General Intelligence which is belived to be as intelligent as all humans combined. It will still take about a few hundred years to be amongst us. Here are some of the possiblities that we can expect from AI in the future.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-left:40px;">Robots will keep us safer, especially from disasters</h2>

			<p>AI robotic will drastically minimize the risk of traffic accidents and deaths. And will also be able to minimize the damages and protect the life of civilians in any disaster for example, the nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant. AI robotics may as well in the near future will be able to predict natural disasters and can help millions of people from danger. Projects like Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (AIDR) from the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) are determined to make better use of the volunteer time. To do this, the AIDR algorithm is basically looking over the volunteers shoulders while they are processing a small amount of data. The machine learns from every decision, until it understands the patterns well enough to process the data itself. Datasets it is unsure about are returned to the volunteers for review and their decisions then improve the algorithm further. According to QCRI, the algorithm frequently reaches confidence levels of over 80 per cent, meaning that huge amounts of data can be analysed in a fraction of the time it would take volunteers.</p>

			<p>AI researchers have been trying to develop and utilize AI in the field of medicine for several decades. The recent development of the artificial neural network, or ANN a program that utilizes the combined knowledge of its network connections and then learns from the data, in the fashion of a biological brain has really opened the door. In 2009, Mayo Clinic researchers reported that they had put data on 189 cardiac patients with implanted medical devices into such a system and that the software had screened them for potentially fatal heart infections with better than 99 percent accuracy. Not only did the software spot 72 of 73 implant-related infections, but it accomplished that without having to insert an endoscope down their throats to look around a potentially risky invasive procedure .While no one wants computers to replace human doctors, AI systems can help make them more effective in treating patients. AI robotics will also be able to operate surgeries that even doctors cannot perform. It is believed that in near future robots may perform all types of operation instead of doctors.</p>

		<br>
			<h2 style="margin-left:40px;">Smart computers could solve all our problems, including climate change</h2>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<!-- Div for the third -->
		<div id="third">
			<p>In the future AI will be able to perform any task given by the user. From taking care of children's to performing surgeries, participate in war, providing the necessary information to the user in couple of seconds, building rockets, exploring space without being controlled by user are some of the qualities that AI in the future will be able to perform. Also it will be able to predict the climate change of any part of the world accurately. In the future AI will be the most powerful tool for us humans that will be able to fulfil our needs and desires.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-left:40px;">AI will take over many of our jobs</h2>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<!-- Div for the fourth -->
		<div id="fourth">
			<p>In the future many of humans might lose their job to AI. If self-driving in the future becomes cheaper then automatically drivers will lose their job. Not only this if AI in medicinal field is developed as expected then doctor might as well lose their jobs. AI will affect every field in the near future so there is large risk emerging that AI will take over our jobs leaving us jobless. This is one of the most important thing that we must take care, realise and come up with a solution. This is the type of risk that must be feared by the humans.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-left:40px;">Future of AI in games</h2>
		<br>

		<!-- Div for the fifth-->
		<div id="fifth">
			<p>AI has significantly developed in the sector of games in the past decades. AI systems has now become one of the most lethal/important component for game developers as creating solid gameplay and striking visuals. At the moment [Guerrilla Games] is using a specific type of planner for  NPCs called Hierarchical Task Network (HTN), Straatman says. "This is capable of generating more complex plans than what we had before Killzone 2. We also keep on improving things like the CPU performance, which means we can support more NPCs in Killzone 3 than we could in Killzone 2. The terrain-reasoning systems we generate have also evolved over our various titles. We are now able to deal with much more dynamic terrain (like obstacles moving around or changing shape) than ever before. Our data on where there is cover has also become more detailed, something that allows NPCs to deal with more complex environments such as multistory buildings, etc."</p>
			<p>AI is developing step by step in games and now has become one of the most important component that a game must consist of. Without AI the games become much duller. So the game developer are focusing more  on AI system in other to make their games user friendly and attractive.</p>
